    "It looks like you're discussing how to determine the predicted label from a neural network's output, and you mentioned the possibility of setting a threshold to handle cases where the model's confidence is below a certain level. This is a common technique used in classification tasks, especially when dealing with neural networks. Here's how you can implement it:\n",

Adjust the `threshold` value according to your specific problem and dataset to achieve the desired level of confidence."

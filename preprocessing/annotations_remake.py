# It looks like the code you've provided splits the annotations into training and validation sets based on the class names, but it doesn't consider the category names within each class. If you want to split the annotations for each image file and its associated categories, you'll need to modify the code slightly. Here's how you can achieve that:

import json
import random

# Load the annotation.json file
with open('/home/sicily/cv4e_cagedbird_ID/data/high/annotations.json', 'r') as f:
    annotations = json.load(f)

# Initialize lists for training and validation annotations
training_annotations = []
validation_annotations = []

# Define the split ratio (80% training, 20% validation)
split_ratio = 0.8

# Iterate through each class in the annotation
for class_name, class_annotations in annotations.items():
    total_samples = len(class_annotations)
    split_index = int(total_samples * split_ratio)

    # Randomly shuffle the annotations
    random.shuffle(class_annotations)

    # Split annotations into training and validation
    training_annotations.extend(class_annotations[:split_index])
    validation_annotations.extend(class_annotations[split_index:])

# Create and write the training.json file
with open('/home/sicily/cv4e_cagedbird_ID/data/high/training_new.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(training_annotations, f, indent=4)

# Create and write the validation.json file
with open('/home/sicily/cv4e_cagedbird_ID/data/high/validation_new.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(validation_annotations, f, indent=4)

print("Splitting and writing completed.")

# In this modified code, the annotations are directly split into training and validation lists, regardless of their class names. This way, each annotation will include the image file information and its associated categories. The resulting `training.json` and `validation.json` files will contain a list of annotations rather than being structured based on class names.

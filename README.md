**Multi-class, single target classification of birds sold in wildlife marketplaces**

* Structure of data and labels
  * images of bird species from different sensors are stored in folders under data_root/high, there is one bird per image (*single target*)
  * these are named species_name_index_source.fileextension
  * In the overall annotations_new.json file is an entry for every image, its annotation (which is 1-1, i.e. there is one annotation per image) and the overall class, or category that it belongs to

  * Folder structure
   * preprocessing folder
   * annotations_backup: copies of the annotations files that are generated by the scripts in the preprocessing folder - when running the code, these are stored in the ./data folder, as they are read in along with the imagePaths
    * train.json is a random split (though using the same random seed for reproducibility) which contains 80% of the original data, across all initial 29 classes (training_18_08.json is an older version of the split, which contained some bad data and one class, the coal tit, which has since been completely removed since the crops were corrupted)
    * val.json is 20% of the original data, and generated at the same time as train.json (val_18_08.json)
    * upsampling json - is an attempt to balance the classes. In this file, it contains balanced data across all 29 classes
